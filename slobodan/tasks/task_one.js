/**SECTION: Multiplication table */
// Integrate a multiplication table for numbers from
// 1 to 10, from lowest to highest. The goal is to write as little
// code as possible.
//
// Exam passing when:
//    1. Each multiplication table is created and logged.
//    2. The function that multiplies numbers should take an argument, and that argument
//       will state for how much a table should run. For example, that argument can be
//       number 12, and then all the numbers in the array below in task data should be multiplied
//       up to 12 times, for each number, starting from 1.
